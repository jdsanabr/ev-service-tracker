**EV Service & Maintenance Tracker**
A full-stack web application designed for electric vehicle owners and service centers to seamlessly manage vehicle maintenance records, track upcoming service schedules, and access historical data. Built with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, the platform delivers a responsive, user-friendly interface with secure JWT-based authentication. The backend REST API is designed for scalability with a modular architecture, allowing future integration of predictive maintenance using AI, mobile app support, and third-party APIs. Deployed on Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend), this project showcases proficiency in modern software engineering workflows, including Git version control, CI/CD readiness, and relational database design.
